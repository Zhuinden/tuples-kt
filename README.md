# Tuples-KT

Tuples-KT contains tuples from 4 (`Tuple4`) to 16 (`Tuple16`) arity, to make up for that Kotlin only has `Pair` and `Triple`.

## Using Tuples-KT

In order to use Tuples-KT, you need to add `jitpack` to your project root `build.gradle.kts`
(or `build.gradle`):

``` kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
allprojects {
    repositories {
        // ...
        maven { setUrl("https://jitpack.io") }
    }
    // ...
}
```

or

``` groovy
// build.gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        // ...
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
    // ...
}
```

and then, add the dependency to your module's `build.gradle.kts` (or `build.gradle`):

``` kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
implementation("com.github.Zhuinden:tuples-kt:1.0.0")
```

or

``` groovy
// build.gradle
implementation 'com.github.Zhuinden:tuples-kt:1.0.0'
```
